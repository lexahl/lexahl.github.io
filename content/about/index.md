My creative and professional practice focuses on critically re-imagining and speculating diverse futures of technology and society through various digital mediums and materials. My research and teaching lies in multidisciplinary and collaborative practices that encourage reflection on data and digital technologies. I hope to create conversations to help envision a future where digital technologies are more regenerative and less extractive.
